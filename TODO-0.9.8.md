# Fixes

* Fix background in split mode

# Taken from github's issues

* In the Configuration Menu where i can select the default folders, 
  some tool-tips with the description of each folder and its default 
  value would be nice. (https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/issues/210)

* "When i press the insert-key to overwrite some text, it keeps 
  inserting the text, it would be good if this key would work too."

* background color for button. Maybe a new flat button would be better
