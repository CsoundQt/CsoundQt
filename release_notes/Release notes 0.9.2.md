### New in version 0.9.2:

* CsoundQt tries to keep **one running instance**. When new Csound file is opened in file manager, it forwards the info to the running instance and it opens the file **in a new tab**. You can start also more than one instances of CsoundQt if you start the program without any arguments (i.e not opening a file).    

* For Unix/Linux builds there is now the **install target** for system wide installation (Run `sudo make install`). It installs and registers also mime-types for Csound files, a desktop start-up file and icon for CsoundQt. So it is now easy to open CsoundQt or any Csound files with CsoundQt.

* **Virtual MIDI keyboard** has been improved -  new sliders for control channels, possibility to **play notes on computer keys** (keyboard mapping is similar to Csound's VirtualMidi (Z - lowest C, S - C#, X - lowest D etc), see <http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MidiTop.html>, Table 6

* There is ** Virtual MIDI keyboard button on toolbar**

* **Midi Learn button** is straight accessible from widget's properties dialog window.
 
* **MIDI button** (or similar controller) can **start a Csound event** defined in a Button Widget properties, if the type of the button is set to "event".



### Fixes

* *sensekey* works now when CsoundQt is launched  via desktop file or from Applications (Linux, OSX)

* Better search paths in project files to find *rtmidi* and *pythonqt* sources

* Fixed some paths and configuration for OSX build

* Fixed occasional pink widget panel background

* Restore cursor position after evaluating a section (on an arrow key press).

* Virtual Midi Keyboard is shown/hidden correctly on toggling the button/menu item, destroyed correctly on exit.

* Parenthesis markup is corrected so that it does not brake undo chain any more.

* Fixed selection end (mouse release) outside editor panel.

* Show Midi Learn and midi controls only for widgets that accept MIDI.

* Widgetpanel shown/hidden state gets restored correctly on strartup.

* Fixed Midi Learn CC number detection.

* Fixed indentation (many Tab presses actually create tabs)



### Plans for further development
* Table editor for GEN7 and GEN5 tables
* Import/export Cabbage files (conversion between CsoundQt widgets and Cabbage widgets -  partly done: Insert/Update Cabbage text)
* Work with QMLwidget 
* Test debugger and html5
* Work on UI and usability
