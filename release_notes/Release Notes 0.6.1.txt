Hi all!

QuteCsound 0.6.1 is out! It's been so long since the last release, that
even though some of the features I wanted to complete for it aren't done,
the amount of changes and fixes, will hopefully be welcome.

QuteCsound is a frontend for Csound featuring a highlighting
editor with autocomplete, interactive widgets and integrated help. It
can open files created in MacCsound, and aims to be a simple yet
powerful and complete development environment for Csound.

QuteCsound has been tested on Windows, OS X, Linux and Solaris,
and it is free software released under the LGPLv2 or at your option
GPLv3.

There are binary packages for Windows and OS X, and a source package
for other platforms.
You can get it here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/files/QuteCsound/0.6.1/

There's more information here (along with an overdue home page revamp):
http://qutecsound.sourceforge.net/

There is also an experimental package for OS X (called "-full"), which
contains Csound inside, so you don't need a separate Csound installation,
(which means it will work immediately without installation - very handy if
you don't have the root password for a system).

Please try it and let us know any issues.

Questions, comments and suggestions for QuteCsound are very welcome
and can be posted to the main Csound mailing list, but better still,
join the QuteCsound users mailing list at:
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/qutecsound-users

Thanks as usual to the testing team, who made sure regular users get a
smooth ride by taking a bumpy ride...
Thanks especially to Francois Pinot, Andy Fillebrown, Joachim Heintz
and Rene Djack, but also to the translators and the rest of the testers.

QuteCsound accepts donations. If you find QuteCsound useful
and have some money to spare, please consider donating to the project,
to support development:
