How to add a new translation to CsoundQt
========================================


1. In qcs.pro (around line 134), add a line like
	"src/translations/qutecsound_fa.ts"

2. In QtCreator, run
	Tools > Externals > Linguist > update translations 
   You should now find a file named qutecound_fa.ts in src/translations

3. After the translator has been filled out this file with help of the QtLinguist,
   save it in src/translations and run in QtCreator
	Tools > Externals > Linguist > release translations 
   This should create the .qm file related to the .ts file.

4. In src/application.qrc (around line 145), insert a line like
        <file>translations/qutecsound_fa.qm</file>

5. In src/qutecsound.cpp (around line 2534) add the translator, like
	text += tr("Persian translation: Amin Khoshsabk") + "<br />";

6. In src/configlists.cpp add the language name und the language code (around line 54)
