 CHANGES:
 
 Renamed CsoundQt.desktop to csoundqt.desktop
 qcs.pro
 Use desktop-file-install to install the desktop file
 
fixed creating link csounqt to correct binary (in install dir csoundqt -> CsoundQt->CsoundQt-d-html-cs6-debug or whatever is installed) -  this enables to have several versions installed, just change the link to use correct one.

corrected icons installed path to: $SHARE_DIR/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps

renamed icon to csoundqt.svg
changed Examples dir from qutecsound to csoundqt, fixed also code for checking that

Added conditions to find rtmidi from system - it checks if /usr/include/rtmidi or /usr/local/include/rtmidi exist (ie if it is installed by the user or package management -  both rtmidi and rtmidi-dev pacakges must be installed!) sets config option system_rtmidi that omits compiling rtmidi from sources.
